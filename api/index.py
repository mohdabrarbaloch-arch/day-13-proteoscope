"""Vercel serverless entrypoint.

Vercel's Python runtime imports this module and looks for a module-level ASGI
callable named ``app``. Everything real lives in ``app.main``; this file only
exists to expose it at the path Vercel expects.

Two things matter here and both are easy to get wrong:

1. ``includeFiles`` in ``vercel.json`` must resolve from the *project root* so
   the whole ``app/`` package ships. A config that resolves it relative to this
   file's own directory silently produces a bundle with no ``app`` package and a
   500 on every request.
2. ``init_db()`` runs at import time. Vercel does not reliably fire the ASGI
   lifespan handler, so relying on the startup hook leaves the tables missing.
